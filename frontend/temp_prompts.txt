okay great work so far. we will now start building the home page with a component that will be dependant on a state variable called oldUser, if the oldUser is false the new component called uploadDoc will be shown on the whole page. this will contain a prompt saying, "Ready to brainrot, Just upload your study document and let's get started  under the prompt there will be an upload document button using which the users can upload a file"
